The Card Matching Game is a card game (single player) is using one deck of playing cards. The object of the game is to match as many cards as you can by turning the cards face up in pairs of the same value.
At the beginning of play turn two cards face up, one at a time. If they are a pair, such as 2 Aces or 2 Threes, you matched the two cards. See if you can turn up another pair. Keep on playing until you turn up all cards.

As the game continues, you will be able to remember the positions and values of some of the cards that have been turned up. If your memory is good, you will be able to find the cards you need to make pairs.

Test your skills against the clock! The game ends when all the cards have been made into pairs.
